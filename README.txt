SimpleNeutron

INTRO:
Implementing Monte Carlo and Finite-Difference neutron transport equations as a header based library in C. 
Based on course-work for NSE 451.

USAGE:
None currently, most work is still done in the main's of the "examples". Compilation script expects DISLIN libraries and windows, if you have those you can look at some graphs.
