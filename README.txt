SimpleNeutron

INTRO:
Implementing Monte Carlo and Finite-Difference neutron transport equations as a header based library in C. 
Based on course-work for NSE 451.

USAGE:
None currently, most work is still done in the main's of the "examples". Compilation script expects DISLIN libraries and windows, if you have those you can look at some graphs.

PLANS:
Move all neutronics code into the header, so just with material info and parameters operations can be preformed.
Power iteration/Monte Carlo k-calc

POSSIBLE PLANS:
Error handling
Multithreading
